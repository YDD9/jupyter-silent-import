This is a repo to show how to do a silent import of a notebook from another Jupyter Notebook.

We're implementing the Monte Carlo algorithm to approximate the value of pi in a "dev" (ie. not very clean and with a number of code blocks that we don't want people to see) notebook [here](pi_approximation_computation.ipynb).

We present the results in a clean notebook [here](Results Presentation.ipynb), where we focus on communcating the results and not on the code.

## Requirements

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
- [Jupyter 4.3](http://jupyter.org/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

I recommend using [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/quickstart/) to install all of those.

## Installation

None required
